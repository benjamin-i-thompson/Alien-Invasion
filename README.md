# Alien-Invasion

Game programmed in Python using PyGame. Programmed for final project.

# Intro

To run this program, you will need to download all files and images. You will also need to have PyGame installed. This particular project was programmed in Python 3.11

alien_invasion.py is the main program.

Both .bmp files will need to be installed and put into an 'images' folder in the workspace. If you choose to place them in a different folder or folder name, you will need to update the ship.py and alien.py files. Changes can be made to line 18 in ship.py (self.image = pygame.image.load('Alien-Invasion/images/ship.bmp')) and line 16 in alien.py (self.image = pygame.image.load('Alien-Invasion/images/alien.bmp')).

# Modifications

Modifications can be made in the settings.py for making the aliens move slower, bullet speed, bullet size, etc.
